# WooCommerce Order Limit

There are times when you need more control over how much can be ordered from your online store. It has to be the right amount so the order is easy to fulfill. That’s where the WooCommerce Order Limit plugin comes in.

The WooCommerce limit order quantity plugin lets you create rules for minimum and maximum order limits. Create rules based on specific customers, products, and categories for both number of items ordered and the total order amount. The WooCommerce Order Limit Plugin gives you complete control over every order that’s placed on your store so you never have to worry about your production and shipping capacities.
